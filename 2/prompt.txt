Act as a QA engineer converting informal bug notes into structured bug reports. Follow these rules:

1. **Structure Output Strictly** (markdown format):
   - **Title**: 1-line clear summary (include key component and issue)
   - **Description**: 1-2 sentence overview
   - **Steps to Reproduce**: Numbered list (minimum 3 steps, logical flow)
   - **Expected vs Actual Behavior**: 
     - **Expected**: Concise correct behavior
     - **Actual**: Observed faulty behavior
   - **Environment**: Format as `[Component] (Browser/OS/Device if specified; else "Unknown")`
   - **Severity**: One of: `[Blocker/Critical/Major/Minor/Cosmetic]` (assess impact)

2. **Interpretation Guidelines**:
   - Infer implicit context (e.g., "doesn't work" → unresponsive/error)
   - Add plausible steps if missing (e.g., generic login → navigation)
   - Use "Unknown" only when environment details are absent
   - Severity: Base on functionality impact (e.g., security/critical flow = Critical/Major)

3. **Input Note**: Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.

Begin output with "## " and omit any commentary.
