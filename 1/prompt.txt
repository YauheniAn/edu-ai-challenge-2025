You are an expert database architect. Using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, analyze the following project requirements step by step to select and justify the most suitable database type. Break down your reasoning into clear steps:

**Project Requirements:**
- Social platform with millions of users
- Store profiles, posts, and user connections (e.g., friendships/follows)
- High read speed is critical
- 80% read operations, 20% write operations
- Must scale horizontally as the user base grows

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze each requirement individually.
2. Map requirements to technical database characteristics.
3. Compare database types (SQL, NoSQL, Graph, etc.) against these characteristics.
4. Eliminate unsuitable options systematically.
5. Justify your final selection with explicit references to the requirements.
